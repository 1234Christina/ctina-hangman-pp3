# Hangman Game
Hangman is a classic word guessing game for children and adults. 
This version was developed in Python. The player is given a word to guess and must guess one letter at a time until they guess the whole word or run out of turns. T win the game the user must guess the word before they run out of turns. 

## User Experience / Features
+ The player is welcomed to the game. 
+ They are shown an instance of a word with blanks for letters and asked to guess a letter.
+ If the player guesses a letter contained in the word they are allowed to input another guess.
+ If their guess is not in the word they see a section of the hangman drawing.
+ Each time the player guesses a letter, it is saved to a list so they won't guess the same letter twice.
+ Incorrect guesses will end the game once the full hangman has been drawn.
+ The player can win the game by correctly guessing all the letters in the word before the hangman is fully drawn..
